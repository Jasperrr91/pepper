            "against a backbone of generally accepted theories and methodologies.",

            "In the first year you are introduced to linguistics, communication science and discourse analysis."
            "You learn how communication processes interact with media,"
            "and explore how media are used in organizational contexts."
            "Of course, we train your general academic skills, such as research methodologies and academic writing.",

            "After the first year, you have a solid base from which to explore various aspects of language in media."

            "We aim to explain why certain aspects of languages are extremely difficult to learn while others are not,"
            "and how this varies for different learner groups."
            "We use this information to critically analyze teaching and assessment materials and to "
            "develop and investigate new teaching methods and language interventions.",

            "First of all, the first year gives you a broad theoretical base reflecting the current state of the art "
            "regarding the structure of language, how language interacts with cognition and what kind of factors "
            "are driving language acquisition. Second, you will learn the basics of adjacent research fields, "
            "such as communication studies and discourse analysis."
            "Last but not least, you will work on some indispensable general academic skills, "
            "such as research methodologies and academic writing.",

            "In the second year, your knowledge of language learning will be further developed as we dive deeper"
            "into a number of linguistic domains, such as phonetics, morphology, semantics. "
            "This will help you become more proficient in recognizing typical and atypical language patterns "
            "in both monolingual and bilingual children. You will also be introduced to the field of language teaching "
            "and you will learn and experience how language teaching may influence "
            "second and foreign language learning, for instance in the module 'second language learning'."
            "We also help you to further develop your academic skills, in the courses 'statistics' and 'philosophy'.",

            "In the first semester of the third year of this Bachelors programme, you will choose a minor programme."
            "You are completely free in your choice, depending predominantly on your future plans and your personal "
            "interests. You can choose from minor programmes such as Brain and Mind, European History and Culture, "
            "Digital Humanities, and many others. In the second semester of this year, "
